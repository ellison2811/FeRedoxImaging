	abstract = {High-resolution Fe K-edge XANES spectra of a series of crystalline Fe2+- and Fe3+-bearing model compounds were measured in an effort to correlate characteristics of the pre-edge feature with oxidation state and local coordination environment of Fe atoms. The model compounds comprise 30 natural minerals and synthetic compounds, with Fe coordination environments ranging from 4 to 12 O atoms for Fe2+, including 5-coordinated trigonal bipyramidal Fe2+, and from 4 to 6 O atoms for Fe3+. Most pre-edge spectra show two components (due to crystal-field splitting) that are located just above the Fermi level.
The most useful characteristics of the Fe-K pre-edge for determining Fe oxidation state and coordination number are the position of its centroid and its integrated intensity. The separation between the average pre-edge centroid positions for Fe2+ and Fe3+ is 1.4 ± 0.1 eV. Thus, the position of the pre-edge feature can be used as a measure of the average Fe-redox state, with the average pre-edge position for mixed Fe2+-Fe3+ compounds occurring between positions for Fe2+ and Fe3+. The lowest pre-edge normalized heights and integrated intensities are observed for the most centrosymmetric sites of Fe, in agreement with previous studies (see Waychunas et al. 1983). Examination of the pre-edge features of mechanical mixtures of phases containing different proportions of Fe2+ and Fe3+ suggests that the pre-edge position and intensity for these mixtures can vary quite non-linearly with the average redox state of Fe. However, distinctly different trends of pre-edge position vs. pre-edge intensity can be observed, depending on the coordination environment of Fe2+ and Fe3+, with an accuracy in redox determination of ±10 mol\% provided that the site geometry for each redox state is known. These methods have been used to estimate the Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio in 12 minerals (magnetite, vesuvianite, franklinite, rhodonite, etc.) containing variable/unknown amounts of Fe2+/Fe3+.},

	abstract = {Estimation of Fe3+/ΣFe ratios in materials at the submicrometre scale has been a long-standing challenge in the Earth and environmental sciences because of the usefulness of this ratio in estimating redox conditions as well as for geothermometry. To date, few quantitative methods with submicrometric resolution have been developed for this purpose, and most of them have used electron energy-loss spectroscopy carried out in the ultra-high vacuum environment of a transmission electron microscope (TEM). Scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) is a relatively new technique complementary to TEM and is increasingly being used in the Earth sciences. Here, we detail an analytical procedure to quantify the Fe3+/ΣFe ratio in silicates using Fe L2,3-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra obtained by STXM, and we discuss its advantages and limitations. Two different methods for retrieving Fe3+/ΣFe ratios from XANES spectra are calibrated using reference samples with known Fe3+ content by independent approaches. The first method uses the intensity ratio of the two major peaks at the L3-edge. This method allows mapping of Fe3+/ΣFe ratios at a spatial scale better than 50 nm by the acquisition of 5 images only. The second method employs a 2-eV-wide integration window centred on the L2 maximum for Fe3+, which is compared to the total integral intensity of the Fe L2-edge. These two approaches are applied to metapelites from the Glarus massif (Switzerland), containing micrometre-sized chlorite and illite grains and prepared as ultrathin foils by focused ion beam milling. Nanometre-scale mapping of iron redox in these samples is presented and shows evidence of compositional zonation. The existence of such zonation has crucial implications for geothermometry and illustrates the importance of being able to measure Fe3+/ΣFe ratios at the submicrometre scale in geological samples.},
