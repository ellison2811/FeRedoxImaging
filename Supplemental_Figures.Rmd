# Data and Analysis Scripts
The raw X-ray data and all of the R code used for the processing and analysis of the maps, error analyses, and generation of figures, are available in a Github repository associated with this work. The data and code can be installed in R in order to replicate the analyses performed here. The code is available at:

# Supplemental Figures

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 7}
SI_figure1
```
**Supplemental Figure 1**: Maps of pre-edge centroid position (A) and integrated intensity (B) prior to gaussian smoothing step. Abbreviations: Ol = olivine, Srp = Serpentine, Pra = Pyroaurite, Hdx = Hydroxide phase, Mgt = Magnetite.  

\pagebreak
```{r}
SI_figure2
```
**Supplemental Figure 2**: Fe redox variogram, showing kernel density of pixels without gaussian smoothing applied to the centroid and intensity maps. Fe(III)/âˆ‘Fe is given by the variogram tielines at 10% intervals. Contour line envelopes that encompass 50%, 75%, and 90% of the total pixel kernel density are also shown.

\pagebreak
```{r}
SI_figure3
```
**Supplemental Figure 3**: Corregistration of the XRF and Raman data sets. Control points in the $\text{TiO}_2$ component of the Raman mineralogy map (orange) and the Ti X-ray fluorescence map were chosen in order to calculate and apply an affine transformation. The resulting transformation of the Ti X-ray fluorescence map is shown (yellow overlay with transparency).

```{r}
SI_figure4
```
**Supplemental Figure 4**: Distribution of errors due to orientation effects. Sine function fit to measured orientation errors in antigorite, which is given by $f(\varphi) = -0.021 + 0.073\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{180^\circ}\varphi + \frac{\pi}{2}\right)$, where $\varphi$ is the orientation angle in degrees [A, modified from @munoz_iron_2013]. Arcsine probability density distribution resulting from the orientation error, which is given by $p(f) = \frac{1}{\pi\sqrt{0.073^2-(-0.021-f)^2}}$ for $-9.4\% < f < 5.2\%$ and $p(f) = 0$ everywhere else (B).
